# API Documentation

#### Backend staged at [Heroku](https://quality-hub-gateway-staging.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## Getting started

To get the server running locally:

- Clone this repo
- **yarn install** to install all required dependencies
- **yarn server** to start the local server
- **yarn test** to start server using testing environment

### Node.js + graphql-yoga + Prisma

We chose this framework for:

- Scalability: since the QualityHub project currently includes Core and InterviewQ (but will include future modules, like ResumeQ, etc.), we wanted to set up a gateway that would connect the different back-ends
- Simplicity: we wanted to set up a gateway so that the various front-end apps associated with the QualityHub project would only need to hit one endpoint
- Flexibility: we chose to implement GraphQL to make it easier for future front-end developers to access the backend schema

## Endpoints

#### Organization Routes

The Gateway current connects the following GraphQL back-end APIs:

QualityHub Core: https://quality-hub-core-staging.herokuapp.com  
InterviewQ: https://qh-interviewq-practice-01.herokuapp.com

The overall schema for the project can be accessed at the GraphQL playground here: https://quality-hub-gateway-staging.herokuapp.com

Specific schemas can be accessed at the playgrounds linked to above.

<!-- | Method | Endpoint                | Access Control | Description                                  |

| PUT    | `/organizatoins/:orgId` | owners         | Modify an existing organization.             |
| DELETE | `/organizations/:orgId` | owners         | Delete an organization.                      |

## Data Model

Specific schemas (data models, queries, mutations) for each of the connected GraphQL back-end APIs can be accessed at the links above.

## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

_ STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
_ NODE\*ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"

- JWT*SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-_=+)') for i in range(50)])
  _ SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account \* stripe_secret - this is generated in the Stripe dashboard
